<h3><u>MY FIRST DAY IN UNIVERSITY</u></h3>
<p style="color:white">
My first month at Numl University is much better than I expected. On my first day at Numl University, I feel nervous because of a lack of confidence,
<br>How to make friends at university and so on.
<br>By that time, I got some confidence and beat my nervousness problem, and make new friends.
<br>At Numl University their staff member and the teacher are so kind and their teaching method is good as compared to my expectation on teaching method.
<br>When I got admission to Numl my relative said to me that the Numl teaching system is not good as compared to other University etc.
