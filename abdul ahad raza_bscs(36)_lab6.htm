<h2>MY 1ST MONTH AT NUML UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p style="background.color:white">My first month at Numl University is much better than I expected. On my first day at Numl University, I feel nervous because of a lack of confidence,
How to make friends at university and so on.
By that time, I got some confidence and beat my nervousness problem, and make new friends.
At Numl University their staff member and the teacher are so kind and their teaching method is good as compared to my expectation on teaching method.
When I got admission to Numl my relative said to me that the Numl teaching system is not good as compared to other University etc.
By now I feel like theyâ€™re all wrong.</p>
<h3>My Prospectus about NUML UNIVERSITY</h3>
<p style="background.color:white">National University of Modern Languages is a very good university which has created an environment for students to learn languages easily and also other faculty like COMPUTER SCIENCE. The overall university is well maintained.</p>
