<h2><center>MY 1ST MONTH IN NUML UNIVERSITY<center></h2>
<h3>MY FIRST DAY IN UNIVERSITY<h3>
<p style="color:white">My first month in Numl University is much better than I expected. On my first day at Numl University, I feel nervous because of a lack of confidence,
How to make friends at university and so on.
By that time, I got some confidence and beat my nervousness problem, and make new friends.
At Numl University their staff member and the teacher are so kind and their teaching method is good as compared to my expectation on teaching method.
But now I feel like theyâ€™re all wrong.</p>
<h3>LIFE IN UNIVERSITY</h3>
<p style="color:white">  
I learned from so much in University life  
"Take an elective for fun.
Live on campus.
Don't be afraid of new experiences.
Get involved in a club or society.
Learn to manage your finances.
Start a fitness routine."</p>
<h3>My Prospectus about NUML UNIVERSITY</h3>
